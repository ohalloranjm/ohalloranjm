I'm a newly trained programmer looking for my first software development job. If you…

- Know someone who's hiring
- Are yourself in a position to hire
- Can put in a good word for me at your friend's buddy's roommate's dad's company

…then _you_ can help me fulfill my lifelong dream of possessing money and then spending it.

(But seriously it would be super appreciated.)

## The Pitch

I'm a full-stack web developer trained at App Academy. I'm one of only ~5 people from our initial cohort of ~50 who graduated without once failing a project or exam, and I did it while building a Discord bot on the side. I like optimizing workflows and I like documentation.

### Accomplishments

[Tatterpig](https://github.com/ohalloranjm/tatterpig) is the culmination of my App Academy training, a full-stack web app for managing TTRPG character sheets, built with Express, Sequelize, and React. Its core functionality and backend are relatively straightforward; I'm proudest of the frontend and UX design.

[Momo](https://github.com/ohalloranjm/momo) is a Discord bot assistant for _Avatar Legends: The Roleplaying Game_ built with Discord.js and Sequelize. It rolls dice and tracks character stats.

At my last non-programming job, I automated away enough of my own workflow (using Excel macros) to cut my hours by ~35% without any loss of productivity. I also led an initiative to improve product labeling, which at the bare minimum saved thousands of dollars in R&D costs over the subsequent year.

## What I Want

- In Person or Hybrid > Remote > No Job
- Established Company > Startup > No Job
- Good and Useful Product > Product of Dubious Value > No Job

None of these are hard lines—I'll take what I can get. Even a remote job for a startup of dubious value is better than no job at all. (I won't work for the military though.)

It also doesn't have to be a web development job, even though that's where my training is focused. I feel confident in my ability to branch out.
