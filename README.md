## Hi, I'm Joy!

I liked wrangling Excel macros so much that I decided to learn how to program for real. And here I am!

My major coding projects are tied to my love of tabletop RPGs: [Tatterpig](https://github.com/ohalloranjm/tatterpig) is a web app for character sheet management, and [Momo](https://github.com/ohalloranjm/momo) is a fan-made Discord bot specifically for _Avatar Legends: The Roleplaying Game_. Both are open to the public as I work on adding more functionality and cleaning up their codebases.

I'm also working on teaching myself TypeScript for a new (as yet private) project.

### Technologies

- **Languages:** JavaScript (my first and truest love), Python, TypeScript (in progress)
- **Backend:** Express, Sequelize, Flask, SQLAlchemy, Alembic, WTForms
- **Frontend**: React, Redux, Recharts
